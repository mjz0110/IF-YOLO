**IF-YOLO: Illumination-Invariant Traffic Sign Detection for Traffic Management Systems**

## Contents

### ðŸ’¡ Illumination-Level Classification
![Illumination Level](./illumination-level.png)  
Illustrates how dataset images are categorized by illumination levels (e.g., bright, dim, dark), which is critical for evaluating robustness under different lighting conditions.

### ðŸ“Š DITS Dataset Statistics
![Dataset Statistics](./DITS%20dataset.png)  
Provides an overview of the DITS dataset, including the number of targets of different sizes and the illumination-level distribution.

### ðŸŽ¯ Detection Results Visualization
![Detection Visualization](./visualization.png)  
Shows detection results from IF-YOLO, demonstrating its capability to handle challenging low-light traffic sign scenarios.

## ðŸ”— Project Page & Code
